# Project All Route Features

- Home  
1) This route, when clicked, takes the user to the home page of the website. It's the landing page that typically displays essential information, featured content.

- Available Foods
1) Clicking on this route leads the user to a page where all available food items are listed. Users can browse and search for food items in this section.

- Add Food
1) The "Add Food" route takes users to a page where they can add new food listings to the website. This is typically a form where users provide details about the food they want to donate.

- Manage My Foods 
1) This route is a private section accessible to logged-in users. It displays a list of food items that the user has added to the website. Users can manage and update the information related to their own donated food items.

- My Food Request
1) Similar to the "Manage My Foods" route, this is a private section for logged-in users. It displays all food requests made by the user. Users can track the status of their requests and potentially cancel them if the food is still available.

- Login/Signup
1) This route provides access to the user authentication system. Users can log in using their email and password, or they can choose to log in through external platforms like Google or GitHub. It also offers the option to switch between the login and registration forms, allowing new users to create an account.

- Filter Section:(Available Foods)
1) Users can input the name of the food they are looking for in a search bar. When they enter a search query and initiate the search, the page will display only the food items whose names match the search query. This allows users to quickly locate specific types of food.

- Sorting Section:(Available Foods)
1)  Users can choose to sort the available food items based on their expiration date. The system will rearrange the food items, displaying those with the earliest expiration dates first. This is valuable for users who want to find food that will remain fresh for the longest period.
